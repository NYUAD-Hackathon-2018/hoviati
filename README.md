# هويتي --> huwayeti --> identify me

Huwayeti adds a blockchain-based claims layer to UNHCR refugee registration to track additional information ascertained by trusted agents (doctors, UN officials, NGO representatives, etc.) about refugees to their UNHCR profile.

>"Registration goes far beyond a mere head count: it is the recording, verifying, and updating of information on people forced to flee so they can be protected." -[UNHCR](http://www.unhcr.org/registration.html)

At the end of last year, 65.3 million people were displaced—”the highest level ever recorded and representing immense human suffering,” the UNHCR said in a statement.

The UNHCR is already actively working to identify refugees. Recently, the UNHCR released a new biometric card for refugees, which UNHCR Senior Protection Officer (Oversight) Michael Wells calls “state-of-the-art technology, one of the highest and best globally, backed with a retina, 10 fingers and face scan.” This card was launched alongisde a mobile app called UNHCR VERIFY-MY, which is designed to let authorities scan the SQR code on the back of a given card and verify its authenticity.
